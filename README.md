# Abstraction-Java-OOP
This was done by folowing along a YouTube video.
Abstraction-is the process of hiding unnecessary information and shows only the important parts to the users.
It hides the implementations details and shows only the functionality to the user.

How?
Create three classes: Main, Vehicle, and Car.
Vehicle class is vague so declare an abstract keyword in it. 
An abstract class cannot be instantiated but have a subclass instead. 
Use Car class and declare the object in the Main class.
To clarify, use Car car = new Car(). 
The Car class does not need a body nor an implementation but instead use an abstract method.
Add an Override method of go in the Car class.
